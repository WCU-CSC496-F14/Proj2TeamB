Okay guys, please go to this website. https://github.com/cykod/Quintus/commit/d68f5991c341e019b842377ef9e379aba2d4de38

This is where we'll start to fix the code so it works for us, we may very likely have to switch some names of files and folders, No problem.

I downloaded the platform example, but I anticipate changing all of the graphics, ( to scale of course) and adding at least some fun stuff. including music.

here's a link to the tutorial for how to add music.

I also believe we need to add animation, which means multiple frames for our sprites, but if we can keep it to one sprite sheet, I think that'll make things easier since that's what
we did in the last project. 

Kelsey, We've kind of agreed that you can make all of the feature/graphical decisions, which I think suits you because you enjoy being creative.
I'm really pushing to get a fuckin' A on this because my grades in this course so far have been less than stellar, so let's get our heads in the game and kick ass. -David
